# hey-monit

Essential monit configuration scripts to have your Rails based server neat, tidy and healthy.

Knowing these scripts better
----------------------------

Please know that these scripts are just basic configuration scripts. Many of these are without any alert mechanism in them. These are the scripts that we use in Production to monitor our clusters.

Using these scripts
-------------------

All you have to do is to copy paste these scripts into the `conf.d` folder of your `monit` installation. For Debian based systems, you will have to paste the scripts in `/etc/monit/conf.d/`

Getting Help
------------

We spend about 40% of our time contributing to Open Source software. That's one of our goals for this year. Please [tweet](https://twitter.com/skcriptd) us with any queries you have.
