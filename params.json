Many of these are without any alert mechanism in them. These are the scripts that we use in Production to monitor our clusters.\r\n\r\nUsing these scripts\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is to copy paste these scripts into the `conf.d` folder of your `monit` installation. For Debian based systems, you will have to paste the scripts in `/etc/monit/conf.d/`\r\n\r\nGetting Help\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWe spend about 40% of our time contributing to Open Source software.
